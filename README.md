# Poll.fm Cheat
A JavaScript snippet for the browser console to automatically vote on a poll.fm poll until you leave the page for good.

First, let me be clear that the specific poll in this example said “Make sure to vote as often as you want…” While I’m calling this a ‘cheat’ and you can definitely use it as such, technically I wasn’t breaking any rules and neither should you.

Honestly polls like this one are annoying, because voting claims to be about talent (i.e. “Which player had the most impressive performance?”), but instead is entirely based on popularity and social media shares. It’s a scam and I love finding ways to cheat scams.

All this code is doing is voting *for you* over and over again. It’s performing exactly the same processes you would be doing if you were voting manually, but it’s much faster and makes it easy to run in the background while you’re working on other things.
